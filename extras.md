### IO Exercise

Create a pizza order CLI (Command Line Interface) app using the users input fro the terminal.

- Ask for the size of the pizza, show them at least 3 options, each size will have a different price.
- Ask for the type of pizza, show at least 5 options.
- Ask for any extras, ask for at least 5 options. Each extra will cost $1.50 USD. Ask for 3 at least, since we don't know loops at this point we have to ask 3 times.
- At the end ask for the users info like name, address, phone number and calculate the final price  (Make it look like a ticket). Use the proper data type for each variable that you need to create for your app.
